I want to change some thiings. Add squirel, rabbit, quail, and woodpecker to meats. For veggies add tomatos, green beans, Okra, and Collards.  For fruits, add Mando, Avocado, Starfruit, Dragon Fruit and Carambola. For Ocecans add Conch, Lionfish, Catfish, Bass and Crappie.  The food ingrtedient emojiis are all the same. What does "Steal this recipe" button do?  mayeb remove it and add a copy to clipboard ans share to X, facebook.  Find 10 funny products on amazon, add links my ID is bshoemak-20. Also add image links.  Rewrite the privacy policy to be rednecj funny.  I have a final idea to add amazon affilaite links for groceries to the recipe food/ingredient "Grub Pile".  also possibly as a batch add so all links are added to a user's amazon kart. 
 change them. Tone down the crazy API app.py, I want recipes that work.  Some funny is fine. then let's debug locally with expo, and send to git and render
